**Title:** Probing Canopy-Break Anomalies Along the Upper Xingu

**Abstract (≈200 words):**
We investigate a 100×100 km tract within the Brazilian Amazon biome to surface
previously undocumented patterns consistent with anthropogenic earthworks. Using open-source
multispectral satellite scenes and published LiDAR tiles, we combine algorithmic screening
(scikit-image edge transforms and shape detection) with human-in-the-loop review assisted by a
large language model. Two independent evidence streams converge on one candidate near levee-like
geomorphology: (i) spectral/texture anomalies stable across seasons, and (ii) rectilinear/curvilinear
signatures typical of enclosure ditches. We log all dataset identifiers (tile/scene IDs), prompts,
models and versions, and geodetic metadata in JSONL for reproducibility. Preliminary overlays
against colonial diaries and Indigenous oral maps suggest plausible settlement alignment along a
secondary channel. We discuss alternative natural explanations (treefall gaps, erosional scarps) and
outline next steps, including targeted acquisition of higher-resolution elevation data and expert
review by regional archaeologists. Our work illustrates a transparent, extensible workflow for
candidate discovery that others can replicate and falsify.
