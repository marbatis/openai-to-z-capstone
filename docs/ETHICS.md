# Ethics & Sensitive Data Handling

- Avoid disclosing precise coordinates of potential sites in public repos.
- Follow local laws, community guidelines, and consult with archaeologists where possible.
- Prefer bounding boxes and obfuscated markers in public artifacts; share exact points only with trusted experts.
- Respect Indigenous knowledge and request permission to cite oral histories.
- Attribute and cite all data sources (LiDAR tile IDs, STAC scene IDs, DOIs).
